## Peer to Peer Backup System
Virtual machine instances can be created on google cloud or localhost. 
We have automated the peer creation in google cloud.
The tracker is assumed to be up and running always in our system. The role of the tracker is to remain connected to all the peers in the network and allow new peer addition to the network.
With each peer in the network, it will execute source (peer.py) code and will display menu for user input.
